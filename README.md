# AgeingForecastingMOSFETs
This repository contains the code of the paper "Comparative Analysis and Evaluation of Aging Forecasting Methods for Semiconductor Devices in Online Health Monitoring" by Adrian Villalobos (Mondragon University, Spain), Iban Barrutia (Mondragon University, Spain), Rafael Pe√±a-Alzola (University of Strathclyde, UK), Tomislav Dragicevic (DTU - Technical University of Denmark), and Jose I. Aizpurua (University of the Basque Country and Ikerbasque Basque Foundation for Science, Spain), published in Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence.

The Code folder includes Jupyter Notebooks with (i) short-term Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) experiments (ii) long-term Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) experiments (leave one out) and (iii) extraction of explainability features and attention points from the TFT.
